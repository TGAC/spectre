Dependencies
============

Phybre is a maven project, so almost all the dependencies will be downloaded automatically as part of the Maven buildcycle.  However, the one exception to this is a java library called metaopt, which provides a common interface to several open source and commercial optimizers.  Metaopt can be obtained from: https://github.com/maplesond/metaopt.  Please follow the instructions in the metaopt README and make sure the metaopt library has been added to your local maven repository.  After this, you can proceed with the installation instructions for phybre.
