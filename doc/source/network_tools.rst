Network Tools
=============



Netmake:
--------

Creates a compatible split system and a circular ordering from a distance matrix and either a single weighting or a hybrid
weighting configuration. The following paragraph describes the implemented algorithms.

The NeighborNet algorithm, introduced by D. Bryant and V. Moulton \citep{Bryant2004}, is a popular tool for
constructing a weighted circular split system that can be represented by a circular split network.
D. Levy and L. Pachter (levy and Pachter, 2007) propose a framework for constructing circular split systems based on NeighborNet,
and pointed out that, depending on the adjustment of this framework, it can be used to produce circular split systems with interesting properties.
For example, constructing a circular split system in a certain way guaranties that it contains a compatible split system corresponding to the NeighborJoining tree.
we also implemented a new way to construct a circular split system by greedily optimising the minimum evolution criterion.
Netmake can be run using these different algorithms to construct circular split systems (networks).

For more information please see Thesis Sarah Chapter 3 (can we attach this somehow?)

To run Netmake use the ``Netmake`` script like this::

  Netmake -o <outfile> [-s <scaling_optimiser> -x <primary_optimiser>
         -y <secondary_optimiser> -b <objective> -f <filter_threshold>] <input_file> [<input_file>]...


NetME:
------

Constructs a minimum evolution (ME) tree from the specified network with its implied circular order.

Here we consider the problem of searching through a set of splits that is circular. Such
sets can, for example, be generated by the NeighborNet algorithm or any for constructing phylogenetic networks (some method implemented in Netmake).
More specifically, NetMake is the implementation of an O(n 4 ) algorithm for finding an optimal minimum evolution tree in a circular
set of splits on a set of species of size n.

For more information on the algorithm please see and please cite:
S. Bastkowski, A. Spillner, V. Moulton (2014) Fishing for Trees with NeighborNets. Information Processing Letters 114(1-2): 13-18.


To run NetME use the ``NetME`` script like this::

  NetME -o <outfile> [-s <scaling_optimiser> -x <primary_optimiser>
         -y <secondary_optimiser> -b <objective> -f <filter_threshold>] <input_file> [<input_file>]...

Alternatively, NetME and NetMake have a simple combined GUI which can be started by simply running ``netme-gui`` without any arguments.
