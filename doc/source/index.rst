Spectre is an open source project containing a collection of tools for inferring and visualising reticulate evolution.
 The tools are primarily based around generating and processing split systems (a collection of bipartitions of the taxa).
It contains a number of previously published methods for generating networks and trees for various types from a range of different inputs.
Spectre also contains a library containing data structures and algorithms that can be leveraged by third party applications.
